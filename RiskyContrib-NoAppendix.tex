\section{The base model}

\subsection{Life-Cycle Model}\label{sec:mod_lc}

The life-cycle model resembles that in \cite{Cocco2005rfs}, with modifications
to the portfolio allocation problem and the income process. I now discuss the main
components of the model, which I summarize in its formal recursive representation
in Appendix \ref{app:lc_model_recursive}.

\subsubsection{Lifespan, mortality, and utility}

Agents enter the model at age 24 and can live up to a maximum age of 100.
Each  period, they face an exogenous risk of death that becomes certain at the 
maximum age. There are no intentional bequests: agents will consume all of their 
resources if they make it to the maximum age, but can leave accidental 
bequests upon premature death.

In each period, agents derive utility from consumption only. 
Their utility function follows a constant relative risk aversion 
specification. Formally, for a level of 
consumption $C$, the agent derives instant utility
\begin{equation}
	u(C) = \frac{C^{1-\rho}}{1- \rho}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Income process}

Agents supply labor inelastically and retire exogenously at age 
65. Pre-retirement labor earnings $Y_{i,t}$ are the product of a permanent
component $P_{i,t}$ and a transitory stochastic component $\theta_{i,t}$ as
in \cite{Carroll1997qje}. Formally,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\ln Y_{i,t} &= \ln P_{i,t} + \ln \theta_{i,t} \\
\ln P_{i,t} &= \ln P_{i,t-1} + \ln \Gamma_{i,t} + \ln \psi_{i,t}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $\Gamma_{i,t}$ is a deterministic growth factor that captures
life-cycle patterns in earnings, and
$\ln \psi_{i,t}\sim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma^2_{\psi,t}/2, \sigma_{\psi,t})$
is a multiplicative shock to permanent income\footnote{The mean of the shock is set so that $E[\psi_{i,t}] = 1$.}.

The transitory component $\theta_{i,t}$ is a mixture that models unemployment and
other temporal fluctuations in income as
\begin{equation*}
\ln\theta_{i,t} = \begin{cases}
\ln \mathcal{U}, & \text{With probability } \mho\\
\ln \tilde{\theta}_{i,t}\sim\mathcal{N}(-\sigma^2_{\theta,t}/2, \sigma_{\theta,t}), & \text{With probability } 1-\mho,
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
with $\mho$ representing the probability of unemployment and $\mathcal{U}$ the replacement
factor of unemployment benefits.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\FigDir/RESULTS/Determ_income_paths}
\caption{Deterministic Component of Income by Education Level}\label{fig:income_paths}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The sequences of growth factors $\{\Gamma_{i,t}\}_{t=25}^{100}$ vary by educational attainment,
and their calibration comes from \cite{Cagetti2003jbes}. Figure \ref{fig:income_paths}
displays the income paths that individuals with different education levels would experience
in the absence of shocks\footnote{This is $P_{i,24}\times\prod_{j=25}^{t} \Gamma_{i,t}$.}. The
decline at age 65 corresponds to retirement and after this point income becomes deterministic,
following $Y_{i,t} = P_{i,t} = P_{i,t-1}\Gamma_{i,t}$.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\FigDir/RESULTS/Income_volatility_paths}
\caption{Age Profiles of Income Volatility}\label{fig:volat_paths}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

An important advance in life-cycle modeling has been the recognition that
the volatility of income varies with age. \cite{Sabelhaus2010jme} estimate
age profiles of both transitory and permanent shock volatilities, which I
incorporate as the values of $\{\sigma_{\theta,t}, \sigma_{\psi,t}\}_{t=24}^{64}$.
Figure \ref{fig:volat_paths} presents these volatilities, which are large and have
a clear downward trend in age. Income fluctuations are the main motive for saving
at early ages in the model and therefore these volatility patterns will have
implications for portfolio choice.

\subsubsection{Financial assets and frictions}\label{sec:fin_frictions}

Agents smooth their consumption by saving and have two assets
available for this purpose. The first is a risk-free liquid account with 
constant per-period return factor $R$. The second represents stocks
and has a stochastic return factor $\tilde{R}$ that agents view as 
log-normally distributed and independent across time. Importantly,
consumption must be paid for using funds from the risk-free liquid account.
The levels of risk-free and risky assets owned by the agent will both be state
variables, denoted with $M_{i,t}$ and $N_{i,t}$ respectively.

Portfolio rebalancing takes place by moving funds between the risk-free
and risky accounts. These flows are one of the agents' control variables
and are denoted as $D_{i,t}$, with $D_{i,t}>0$ representing a movement of
funds from the risk-free to the risky account. Withdrawals from the risky
account are taxed at a constant rate $\tau$, representing capital taxes or
early retirement fund withdrawal penalties. In sum, denoting post-rebalancing
levels with
$\tilde{\cdot}$,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\tilde{M}_{i,t} &= M_{i,t} - D_{i,t}(1 - 1_{[D_{i,t}\leq0]}\tau)\\
\tilde{N}_{i,t} &= N_{i,t} + D_{i,t}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

At any given period, an agent might not be able to rebalance his portfolio.
This ability is governed by an exogenous stochastic shock that is realized
at the start of the period
\begin{equation*}
\Adj_t \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_t),
\end{equation*}
with $\Adj_t=1$ meaning that the agent can rebalance and $\NAdj_t=1$ ($\Adj_t = 0$)
forcing him to set $D_{i,t} = 0$. This friction is a parsimonious way to capture
the fact that portfolio rebalancing is costly and households do it sporadically
\cite{Giglio2019nber}.

To partially evade the possibility of being unable to rebalance their accounts, agents
can use an income deduction scheme. By default, labor income and retirement
benefits ($Y_{i,t}$) are deposited to the risk-free liquid account at the start
of the period. However, agents can pre-commit to have a fraction  $\Contr_t\in[0,1]$
of their income diverted to their risky account instead. This fraction can be
tweaked by the agent whenever $\Adj_t = 1$; otherwise it stays at its
previous value, $\Contr_{t+1} = \Contr_t$.

These frictions to stockholding represent a departure from the usual modeling
approach that is followed in the literature. The most usual friction to
stockholding in the literature is a fixed monetary cost that agents must pay
every period in which they hold stocks. This framework's convenience comes from
only having to track total wealth as a state variable---as opposed to tracking
both $M_{i,t}$ and $N_{i,t}$---as agents risky-asset positions are liquidated
every period before they decide whether to enter the stock market again. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{\FigDir/SUMSTATS/Rebalancing_by_wave}
\end{center}
\caption{Portfolio Rebalancing in the HRS}\label{fig:rebalancing}
\end{figure}

While convenient, this framework has problematic implications. First, it assumes
that agents liquidate their portfolios and decide whether to re-enter the stock
market every period, with the friction placed on this decision. This implication
contradicts the fact that people rarely rebalance their portfolios as shown by 
Figure \ref{fig:rebalancing}. One can imagine that if a person starts a
period with $90\%$ of their wealth in stocks, the path of least resistance
for them would be to preserve their portfolio instead of fully liquidating it.
A second problem that this friction introduces in heterogeneous agent models
is selection; an entry barrier limits stockholders to be those whose eagerness
overcomes the cost and therefore it raises the share of wealth invested in stocks
conditional on participation above the already-too-high prediction of the
frictionless model.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\FigDir/RESULTS/Frict_sim_CONDSHARE_slides}
\end{center}
\scriptsize ``Frictionless'' corresponds to a version of the model in which
agents can always adjust their portfolio ($\{p_t\}_{t=24}^{100} = 1$) and are
not subject to taxes ($\tau = 0$). ``Tax'' is a version in which $\tau = 0.1$.
``Calvo'' is a version in which agents have a $25\%$ chance of being able to
rebalance in every period ($\{p_t\}_{t=24}^{100} = 0.25$). ``Tax $+$ Calvo''
is a version with the two previous frictions added simultaneously.

\caption{Frictions and Their Interaction With Beliefs.}\label{fig:frict_beliefs}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:frict_beliefs} shows the effects of the frictions in my model
on the share of wealth in stocks conditional on participation, and their
interaction with beliefs about the equity premium. A major challenge in the
life-cycle portfolio literature is explaining the low share of wealth that
young people place in stocks (compare Figures \ref{fig:moments_data} and
\ref{fig:frict_beliefs}). Figure \ref{fig:frict_beliefs} shows that pessimism
about the equity premium combined with either the tax or stochastic rebalancing
friction can substantially reduce the conditional share of young agents, flattening
its age profile and bringing it closer to the data
(see Figure \ref{fig:moments_data}). The interaction between pessimistic beliefs
and frictions to rebalancing will be my strategy for improving the fit of the
life cycle model.

\subsubsection{Timing}

Figure \ref{fig:timing_diagram} summarizes the timing of stochastic shocks and
optimizing decisions that occur within a period of the life cycle model.

\hypertarget{Recursive}{}
\section{Recursive representation of the model}


Individual subscripts are dropped for simplicity. The value function for
an agent who is not allowed to rebalance his portfolio at time $t$ is
\begin{equation*}
    \input{\EqDir/bellman_NAdj}
\end{equation*}
and that of agent who is allowed to rebalance is
\begin{equation*}
    \input{\EqDir/bellman_Adj}
\end{equation*}

The problem can be normalized by permanent income, following
\cite{Carroll2020solvingmicrodsops}. Using lower case variables to
denote their upper-case counterparts normalized by permanent income ($x_t = X_t/P_t$)
and defining $\tilde{\Gamma}_t = \Gamma_{t}\psi_{t}$, we can write
normalized problems
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bellman_NAdj_norm}
\input{\EqDir/bellman_NAdj_norm}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation*}
\input{\EqDir/bellman_Adj_norm}
\end{equation*}
It can be shown that
\begin{equation*}
V_{t}^{\Adj}(M_t,N_t,P_t) = P_t^{1-\rho} v_{t}^{\Adj}(m_t,n_t), \quad
V_{t}^{\NAdj}(M_t,N_t,P_t,\Contr_t) = P_t^{1-\rho} v_{t}^{\NAdj}(m_t,n_t,\Contr_t),
\end{equation*}
and that the policy functions of both problems are related through
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
C_t^{\NAdj}(M_t,N_t,P_t,\Contr_t) = P_t c_t^{\NAdj}(m_t,n_t,\Contr_t),& \quad C_t^{\Adj}(M_t,N_t,P_t) = P_t c_t^{\Adj}(m_t,n_t),\\
D_t(M_t,N_t,P_t) = P_t d_t(m_t,n_t),& \quad \Contr_{t+1}(M_t,N_t) = \Contr_{t+1}(m_t,n_t).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, I solve the normalized problem and re-scale its solutions to obtain
the original problem's solutions.

\subsection{Partition into stages}

An additional insight to facilitate solving the model is that the three decisions
that an agent might take in a period (rebalancing his assets, choosing his income
deduction fraction and consuming) can be seen as happening sequentially. This is
convenient because:
\begin{itemize}
\item The sub-problems are easier to solve than the multi-choice full problem.
\item Since the non-adjusting agent only chooses his consumption and we must
solve his problem for every combination of $(m_t, n_t, \zeta_t=\zeta_{t+1})$, we can re-utilize
his solution by expressing the adjusting agent's  problem as
\begin{equation*}
v_t^{\Adj}(m_t,n_t) = \max_{\tilde{m}_t, \tilde{n}_t, \Contr_{t+1}} v_t^{\NAdj}(\tilde{m}_t, \tilde{n}_t, \Contr_{t+1}).
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

To start re-expressing the problem, take the order of the decisions to be: rebalance
assets, then define income contribution share, then consume, and denote the stages
at which these decisions are taken with $\Reb$, $\Sha$, and $\Cns$. I will use
$v^{\Reb}(\cdot)$, $v^{\Sha}(\cdot)$ and $v^{\Cns}(\cdot)$ to represent
\emph{stage value functions}.

I now present each stage in detail, working backwards in time.

\subsubsection{Consumption stage, $\Cns$}

An agent who takes his assets and income contribution share as given is one who
can not adjust them and can only choose his consumption. This corresponds to the
problem of the non-adjusting agent (Equation \ref{eq:bellman_NAdj_norm}). The
important facts to realize at this stage are that
\begin{equation*}
v_t^{\Adj}(m_t, n_t) = v_t^{\Reb}(m_t, n_t), \quad v_t^{\NAdj}(m_t, n_t, \Contr_t) = v_t^{\Cns}(m_t, n_t, \Contr_t),
\end{equation*}
with the first fact being true because we have assumed that asset rebalancing
is the first decision that an adjusting agent takes, and he assumes that his
subsequent decisions will be optimal. Therefore, the consumption stage problem is
\begin{equation*}
\input{\EqDir/bellman_cns}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Income contribution share stage, $\Sha$}

An agent with the option to set his income contribution share will do so
taking his asset allocation as given and assuming that he will optimally
pick his consumption in the next stage. His problem is
\begin{equation*}
\input{\EqDir/bellman_sha}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Rebalancing stage, $\Reb$}

The first decision that an agent takes, if allowed, is how to reallocate his
assets.
\begin{equation*}
\input{\EqDir/bellman_reb}
\end{equation*}
