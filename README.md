This repository presents a two-asset consumption-savings model and serves as the documentation of an open-source implementation of methods to solve and
simulate it in the [HARK](https://econ-ark.org/toolkit) toolkit. The model represents an agent who can save using two different assets---one risky and
the other risk-free---to insure against fluctuations in his income, but faces frictions to transferring funds between assets. The flexibility of its
implementation and its inclusion in the HARK toolkit will allow users to adapt the model to realistic life-cycle calibrations, and also to embedded it in
heterogeneous-agents macroeconomic models.
