# # A Two-Asset Savings Model with an Income-Contribution Scheme
#
# ## Mateo VelÃ¡squez-Giraldo
#
# This notebook demonstrates the use of the `RiskyContrib` agent type
# of the [HARK Toolkit](https://econ-ark.org/toolkit). The model represents an agent who can
# save using two different assets---one risky and the other risk-free---to insure
# against fluctuations in his income, but faces frictions to transferring funds between
# assets. The flexibility of its implementation and its inclusion in the HARK
# toolkit will allow users to adapt the model to realistic life-cycle calibrations, and
# also to embedded it in heterogeneous-agents macroeconomic models.

# ## Model Description
#
# I now discuss the main components of the model informally, and leave its full
# recursive mathematical representation for Section \ref{sec:recursive}.
#
# ### Time, mortality, and utility
#
# Time advances in discrete steps that I will index with $t$. The model can
# be used in both infinite and finite-horizon versions.
#
# Agents face an exogenous risk of death $\delta_t$ each period, which becomes certain at the 
# maximum age of the finite-horizon version. There are no intentional bequests; agents
# will consume all of their resources if they reach the last period, but they can leave
# accidental bequests upon premature death.
#
# In each period, agents derive utility from consumption only. Their utility function
# follows a constant relative risk aversion specification. Formally, for a level of 
# consumption $C$, the agent derives instant utility
# \begin{equation}
# 	u(C) = \frac{C^{1-\rho}}{1- \rho}.
# \end{equation}
#
# #### Income process
#
# Agents supply labor inelastically. Their labor earnings $Y_{i,t}$ are the product of a
# permanent component $P_{i,t}$ and a transitory stochastic component $\theta_{i,t}$ as
# in \cite{Carroll1997qje},  where $i$ indexes different agents. Formally,
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# \ln Y_{i,t} &= \ln P_{i,t} + \ln \theta_{i,t} \\
# \ln P_{i,t} &= \ln P_{i,t-1} + \ln \Gamma_{i,t} + \ln \psi_{i,t}
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
# where $\Gamma_{i,t}$ is a deterministic growth factor that can capture
# life-cycle patterns in earnings, and
# $\ln \psi_{i,t}\sim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma^2_{\psi,t}/2, \sigma_{\psi,t})$
# is a multiplicative shock to permanent income\footnote{The mean of the shock is set so that $E[\psi_{i,t}] = 1$.}.
#
# The transitory component $\theta_{i,t}$ is a mixture that models unemployment and
# other temporal fluctuations in income as
# \begin{equation*}
# \ln\theta_{i,t} = \begin{cases}
# \ln \mathcal{U}, & \text{With probability } \mho\\
# \ln \tilde{\theta}_{i,t}\sim\mathcal{N}(-\sigma^2_{\theta,t}/2, \sigma_{\theta,t}), & \text{With probability } 1-\mho,
# \end{cases}
# \end{equation*}
# with $\mho$ representing the probability of unemployment and $\mathcal{U}$ the replacement
# factor of unemployment benefits.
#
# This specification of the income process is parsimonious and flexible enough to accommodate
# life-cycle patterns in income growth and volatility, transitory unemployment and exogenous
# retirement. Introduced by \cite{Carroll1997qje}, this income specification is common in studies
# of life-cycle wealth accumulation and portfolio choice; see e.g.,
# \cite{Cagetti2003jbes,Cocco2005rfs,Fagereng2017jof}. The specification has
# also been used in studies of income volatility such as \cite{Carroll1992bpea,Carroll1997jme,Sabelhaus2010jme}, which have yielded calibrations of its stochastic shocks' distributions.
#
# #### Financial assets and frictions
#
# Agents smooth their consumption by saving and have two assets
# available for this purpose. The first is a risk-free liquid account with 
# constant per-period return factor $R$. The second has a stochastic return
# factor $\tilde{R}$ that is log-normally distributed and independent across
# time. Various interpretations such as stocks, a retirement fund, or entrepreneurial
# capital could be given to the risky asset. Importantly, consumption must be paid for
# using funds from the risk-free account. The levels of risk-free and risky assets
# owned by the agent will both be state variables, denoted with $M_{i,t}$ and $N_{i,t}$
# respectively.
#
# Portfolio rebalancing takes place by moving funds between the risk-free
# and risky accounts. These flows are one of the agents' control variables
# and are denoted as $D_{i,t}$, with $D_{i,t}>0$ representing a movement of
# funds from the risk-free to the risky account. Withdrawals from the risky
# account are subject to a constant-rate tax $\tau$ which can represent, for
# instance, capital-gains realization taxes or early retirement-fund withdrawal
# penalties. In sum, denoting post-rebalancing asset levels with $\tilde{\cdot}$,
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# \tilde{M}_{i,t} &= M_{i,t} - D_{i,t}(1 - 1_{[D_{i,t}\leq0]}\tau)\\
# \tilde{N}_{i,t} &= N_{i,t} + D_{i,t}.
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
#
# At any given period, an agent might not be able to rebalance his portfolio.
# This ability is governed by an exogenous stochastic shock that is realized
# at the start of the period
# \begin{equation*}
# \Adj_t \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_t),
# \end{equation*}
# with $\Adj_t=1$ meaning that the agent can rebalance and $\NAdj_t=1$ ($\Adj_t = 0$)
# forcing him to set $D_{i,t} = 0$. This friction is a parsimonious way to capture
# the fact that portfolio rebalancing is costly and households do it sporadically.
# Recent studies have advocated for \citep{Giglio2021aer} and used
# \citep{Luetticke2021aej_macro} this kind of rebalancing friction.
#
# To partially evade the possibility of being unable to rebalance their accounts, agents
# can use an income deduction scheme. By default, labor income ($Y_{i,t}$) is deposited to
# the risk-free liquid account at the start of every period. However, agents can pre-commit
# to have a fraction  $\Contr_t\in[0,1]$ of their income diverted to their risky account instead.
# This fraction can be tweaked by the agent whenever $\Adj_t = 1$; otherwise it stays at its
# previous value, $\Contr_{t+1} = \Contr_t$.

# ### Recursive representation of the model
#
# Individual subscripts $i$ are dropped for simplicity. The value function for
# an agent who is not allowed to rebalance his portfolio at time $t$ is
#
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# V^{\NAdj}_{t}(M_t, N_t, P_t, \Contr_t) = \max_{C_t} u(C_t) 
# + p_{t+1} &\beta\delta_{t+1} E_t \left[  V^{\Adj}_{t+1}\left( M_{t+1}, N_{t+1}, 
# P_{t+1} \right)\right] +\\
# \left(1-p_{t+1}\right) &\beta\delta_{t+1} E_t\left[V^{\NAdj}_{t+1}\left(M_{t+1}, 
# N_{t+1}, P_{t+1}, \Contr_{t+1}\right) \right]\\
# \text{Subject to:} \quad &\\
# 0\leq& C_t \leq M_t \\
# A_t =& M_t - C_t \\
# M_{t+1} =& R A_t + (1-\Contr_{t+1}) Y_{t+1}\\
# N_{t+1} =& \tilde{R}_{t+1}N_t + \Contr_{t+1}Y_{t+1}\\
# P_{t+1} =& \Gamma_{t+1} \psi_{t+1} P_{t}\\
# Y_{t+1} =& \theta_{t+1} P_{t+1}\\
# \Contr_{t+1} =& \Contr_t
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
#
# and that of agent who is allowed to rebalance is
#
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# V^{\Adj}_{t}(M_t, N_t, P_t) = \max_{C_t,D_t,\Contr_{t+1}} 
# u(C_t) + p_{t+1} &\beta\delta_{t+1} E_t \left[  V^{\Adj}_{t+1}\left( M_{t+1}, 
# N_{t+1}, P_{t+1} \right)\right] +\\
# \left(1-p_{t+1}\right) &\beta\delta_{t+1} E_t\left[V^{\NAdj}_{t+1}\left(M_{t+1}, 
# N_{t+1}, P_{t+1}, \Contr_{t+1}\right) \right]\\
# \text{Subject to:} \quad &\\
# \quad -N_t \leq D_t \leq M_t, \quad \Contr_{t+1} \in& [0,1], \quad 0 \leq C_t \leq \tilde{M}_t\\
# \hfill\\
# \tilde{M}_t =& M_t - D_t\left(1-1_{[D_t\leq0]}\tau\right)\\
# \tilde{N}_t =& N_t + D_t\\
# A_t =& \tilde{M}_t - C_t \\
# M_{t+1} =& R A_t + (1-\Contr_{t+1}) Y_{t+1}\\
# N_{t+1} =& \tilde{R}_{t+1} \tilde{N}_t + \Contr_{t+1}Y_{t+1}\\
# P_{t+1} =& \Gamma_{t+1}\psi_{t+1} P_{t}\\
# Y_{t+1} =& \theta_{t+1} P_{t+1}
# \end{split}
