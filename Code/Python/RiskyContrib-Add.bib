    abstract = { Older wealth holders spend down assets much more slowly than predicted by classic life-cycle models. This paper introduces health-dependent utility into a model with incomplete markets in which preferences for bequests, expenditures when in need of long-term care, and ordinary consumption combine with health and longevity uncertainty to explain saving behavior. To sharply identify motives, it develops strategic survey questions (SSQs) that elicit stated preferences. The model is estimated using these SSQs and wealth data from the Vanguard Research Initiative. The desire to self-insure against long-term-care risk explains a substantial fraction of the wealth holding of many older Americans. }

take risks in their financial decisions. What is the explanation behind these
changes? According to “standard” theory, savers’ investments rest on three
fundamental determinants : present resources; expected risk and returns on
assets, as well as expectations on earned income; and lastly, individual
preferences, especially risk preferences. We use French data from the Pater
panel, a survey collected in 2007 and again in 2009, 2011 and 2014. We show that it is the downward adjustment in the expected return from shares and negative impacts on current resources that help explain why the French are investing less and less in risky assets. Risk preferences, however, have remained stable. In contrast, the resurgence in optimism shown by savers in 2014 did not play out in reality, as the number of shareholders has continued to decrease.

However, the apparent pattern of precautionary wealth is not consistent with a standard parameterization of the life cucle model in which consumers are patient enough to begin saving for retirement early in life; wealth is estimated to be far less sensitive to uncertainty than implied by that model. Instead, our results suggest that over most of their working life time, consumers behave in accordance with the ‘buffer-stock’ models of saving described in Carroll (1992, 1997) or Deaton (1991), in which consumers hold wealth principally to insulate consumption against near-term fluctuations in income.}

annual marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than the roughly 
0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic models (even ones including some 
heterogeneity). The high MPC arises because many consumers hold little wealth

The key ingredients of the model are Epstein–Zin preferences, a fixed stock market entry cost, and moderate heterogeneity in risk aversion. Households with low risk aversion smooth earnings shocks with a small buffer stock of assets, and consequently most of them (optimally) never invest in equities.

The solution method we develop for structural estimation extends the endogenous grid-point method (EGM) to discrete-continuous (DC) problems. Discrete choices can lead to kinks in the value functions and discontinuities in the optimal policy rules, greatly complicating the solution of the model. We show how these problems are ameliorated in the presence of additive choice-specific independent and identically distributed extreme value taste shocks that are typically interpreted as “unobserved state variables” in structural econometric applications, or serve as “random noise” to smooth out kinks in the value functions in numerical applications. We present Monte Carlo experiments that demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the DC-EGM algorithm and the associated maximum likelihood estimator for structural estimation of a life-cycle model of consumption with discrete retirement decisions.},

	percent of fiscal stimulus payments (e.g., tax rebates) are spent on 
	nondurable household consumption in the quarter that they are received. To 
	interpret this fact, we develop a structural economic model where 
	households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid asset (e.g., cash, 
	checking account) and a high-return illiquid asset that carries a 
	transaction cost (e.g., housing, retirement account). The optimal

	despite owning sizable quantities of illiquid assets. Therefore, they 
	display large propensities to consume out of additional transitory income, 
	and small propensities to consume out of news about future income. We 
	document the existence of such households in data from the Survey of 
	Consumer Finances. A version of the model parameterized to the 2001 tax 
	rebate episode yields consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments 
	that are in line with the evidence, and an order of magnitude larger than

We analyze this question using a calibrated version of the stochastic growth model with partially uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and movements in aggregate productivity. Our main finding is that, in the stationary stochastic equilibrium, the behavior of the macroeconomic aggregates can be almost perfectly described using only the mean of the wealth distribution. This result is robust to substantial changes in both parameter values and model specification. Our benchmark model, whose only difference from the representative‐agent framework is the existence of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, displays far less cross‐sectional dispersion and skewness in wealth than U.S. data. However, an extension that relies on a small amount of heterogeneity in thrift does succeed in replicating the key features of the wealth data. Furthermore, this extension features aggregate time series that depart significantly from permanent income behavior. }

Recent evidence on experience effects suggests a long-lasting influence of personally experienced outcomes on investor beliefs and investment but also significant differences across older and younger generations. We formalize experience-based learning in an overlapping generations (OLG) model, where different cross-cohort experiences generate persistent heterogeneity in beliefs, portfolio choices, and trade. The model allows us to characterize a novel link between investor demographics and the dependence of prices on past dividends while also generating known features of asset prices, such as excess volatility and return predictability. The model produces new implications for the cross-section of asset holdings, trade volume, and investors’ heterogeneous responses to crises, which we show to be in line with the data.}

been to infer decision processes from data on observed choices. When decision 
makers act with partial information, economists typically assume that persons 
form probabilistic expectations for unknown quantities and maximize expected 
utility. Observed choices may be consistent with many alternative 
specifications of preferences and expectations, so researchers commonly assume 
particular sorts of expectations. It would be better to measure expectations in 
the form called for by modern economic theory; that is, subjective 
probabilities. Data on expectations can be used to relax or validate 
assumptions about expectations. Since the early 1990's, economists have 
increasingly undertaken to elicit from survey respondents probabilistic 
expectations of significant personal events. This article discusses the history 
underlying the new literature, describes some of what has been learned thus 
far, and looks ahead towards making further progress.},

With IID fundamentals, constant risk aversion, and memory decay calibrated to microdata, the model generates a high and strongly counter-cyclical objective equity premium, while the subjective equity premium is virtually constant. Consistent with this theory, experienced payout growth (a weighted average of past growth rates) is negatively related to future stock market excess returns and subjective expectations errors in surveys, and positively to analyst forecasts of long-run earnings growth.},

Despite their differences, these models have similar implications, and can be analyzed in a unified way. The second group of papers consists of models where investors experience uninsurable income shocks. The goal of this survey is to provide one unified framework to better understand this large literature, and especially to reconcile several of the seemingly inconsistent results found in some seminal papers.},

We study how these variants, summarized as a linear index—known as a polygenic score—are associated with human capital accumulation and labor market outcomes in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We present two main sets of results. First, we find evidence that the genetic factors measured by this score interact strongly with childhood socioeconomic status in determining educational outcomes. In particular, although the polygenic score predicts higher rates of college graduation on average, this relationship is substantially stronger for individuals who grew up in households with higher socioeconomic status relative to those who grew up in poorer households. Second, the polygenic score predicts labor earnings even after adjusting for completed education, with larger returns in more recent decades. These patterns suggest that the genetic traits that promote education might allow workers to better accommodate ongoing skill biased technological change. Consistent with this interpretation, we find a positive association between the polygenic score and nonroutine analytic tasks that have benefited from the introduction of new technologies. Nonetheless, the college premium remains a dominant determinant of earnings differences at all levels of the polygenic score. Given the role of childhood SES in predicting college attainment, this raises concerns about wasted potential arising from limited household resources.}",

    disagreements about the same student, an idea we formalize using a

    with respect to teachers' expectations of 0.12. On average, teachers are 
    overly optimistic, though white teachers are less so with black students. 
    More accurate beliefs are counterproductive if there are returns to 
    optimism or sociodemographic gaps in optimism. We find evidence of both. }

Here, I re-specify their model, capturing the effects of possible, though unlikely, market crashes. While maintaining their model's attractive features, this allows it to explain high equity risk premia and low risk-free returns. It does so with reasonable degrees of time preference and risk aversion, provided the crashes are plausibly severe and not too improbable.}

abstract = {Between 1980 and the early 1990s the variability of labor earnings growth rates across the prime-age working population fell significantly. This decline and timing are consistent with other macro and micro observations about growth variability that are collectively referred to as the “Great Moderation.” The variability of earnings growth is negatively correlated with age at any point in time, and the U.S. working age population got older during this period because the Baby Boom was aging. However, the decrease in variability was roughly uniform across all age groups, so population aging is not the source of the overall decline. The variance of log changes also declined at multi-year frequencies in such a way as to suggest that both permanent and transitory components of earnings shocks became more moderate. A simple identification strategy for separating age and cohort effects shows a very intuitive pattern of permanent and transitory shocks over the life cycle, and confirms that a shift over time in the stochastic process occurred even after controlling for age effects.}
