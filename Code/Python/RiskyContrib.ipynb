    "accidental bequests upon premature death.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each period, agents derive utility from consumption only. Their utility function\n",

    "funds from the risk-free to the risky account. Withdrawals from the risky\n",
    "account are subject to a constant-rate tax $\\tau$ which can represent, for\n",
